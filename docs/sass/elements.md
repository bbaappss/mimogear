**Spotlights**

The spotlight (also commonly referred to as the hero image) can be using by placing the spotlight class and a background image onto the container of your choice. This class makes sure that the background image is centered and covers the full width and height of the container.

```pug
.spotlight(style="background-image: url('./dist/images/super-couple.jpg')")
  h1 Page Title
```

## Sprite

The sprite partial is used to add a width and height for each icon that is included in the generated svg sprite. The example below styles a icon called "mage" with a given width and height. This selector should be nested within `.icon {}` inside the sprite partial.

**Sass**

```sass
.icon {
  /* styles */

  &-mage {
    height: em(20);
    width: em(20);
  }
}
```

**CSS Output**

```css
.icon-mage {
  height: 1.25em;
  width: 1.25em;
}
```

## Type

The type partial contains styles for headings 1-6. Each heading is styled using a respective mixin. By using a mixin, you are able to use these heading styles on elements that aren't headers.

**Sass**

```sass
cite {
  @include h6;
}
```

**CSS Output**

```css
cite {
  margin: 1.25rem 0;
  font-size: 1rem;
  line-height: 1.375;
}
```
