## Root

The root partial styles universal elements, the html element, and the body element. It also makes sure that all elements have `position: relative` and `box-sizing: border-box` by default. Font-size was placed on the body element in order to preserve rem calculations during production.

## Regions

Regions refer to their respective pug regions with the addition of main content region. These elements, namely the header, main content area, and footer, are included on every page by default.

## Sections

Sections are large areas contained within the main region of the document.
